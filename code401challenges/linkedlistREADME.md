# Singly Linked List
Creation of a Linked list that supports node objects of any value type, supporting insertion, search, and printing of values

## Challenge
Create LinkedList class with nested Node class, method to insert, method to print values, method to search if value is contained in list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created nested Node class within LinkedList, accepted values are generic to allow for any value type to be contained

## API
[Binary Search Code](src/main/java/code401challenges/BinarySearch.java)
insert() -> Allows for the insertion of a node of any type into the linked list
includes() -> Searches across the linked list for the value in the argument, returns true if contained, false if not.
toString() -> Returns the string representation of the contents of the linked list.
